# biggest_pal
In this exercise we have to write a **program** that takes a string as argument and prints the biggest palindrome included inside this string, followed by a **newline**.

## My Approach
This exercise is the classic find the [longest palindromic substring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_palindromic_substring), which shows up more often than not in technical interviews. I solved it using two methods:

* [Brute force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search), which times out with the last test.
* [Dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming).

## Helpers
For this program I wrote several helper functions:

[:arrow_backward:][back] ║ [:house:][home] ║ [:arrow_forward:][next]
