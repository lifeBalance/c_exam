# Level 04
Exercises in **level 04** can be classified in the following groups:

## String manipulation
Exercises where we have to split strings, or print their words in some particular order.

Exercise                | ETA
------------------------|----------
[ft_split](./strings/ft_split.md)   | 15 minutes
[rev_wstr](./strings/rev_wstr.md)   | 15 minutes
[rostring](./strings/rostring.md)   | 15 minutes

## Linked lists
The exercises related with linked lists are:

Exercise                | ETA
------------------------|----------
[ft_list_foreach](./lists/ft_list_foreach.md)	| 5 minutes
[ft_remove_if](./lists/ft_list_remove_if.md)	| 10-15 minutes
[ft_sort_list](./lists/ft_sort_list.md)			| 15-20 minutes

The ETA for completion above doesn't take into account the functions that we need for:

* Creating nodes
* Appending them
* And printing the list

> Read [here](./lists/lists.md) to know more.

## Numbers
Some exercises have to do with converting numbers to strings, or dealing with prime numbers.

Exercise                | ETA
------------------------|----------
[fprime](./numbers/fprime.md)               | 10-15 minutes
[ft_itoa](./numbers/ft_itoa.md)             | 10-15 minutes
[ft_itoa_base](./numbers/ft_itoa_base.md)    | 15-20 minutes

## Algorithms
Lastly there's a group of exercises where we have to come up with some sort of algorithm:

Exercise                | ETA
------------------------|----------
[brainfuck](./algorithms/brainfuck.md)          | 20 minutes
[checkmate](./algorithms/checkmate.md)          | 30 minutes
[flood_fill](./algorithms/flood_fill.md)        | 20 minutes
[moment](./algorithms/moment.md)                | 15 minutes
[sort_int_tab](./algorithms/sort_int_tab.md)    | 15 minutes

> `checkmate` is quite long, so even though it's good idea to practice it, may be also a good one to skip it during exam, especially if time is short.
